# ✅ The Gentle Start — Jamalu’s Immersive Learning Method

This page introduces **Jamalu’s soulful learning philosophy** — inspired by how babies absorb language: *slowly, gently, and joyfully*.

You won’t cram.  
You won’t fear grammar.  
You’ll **listen, feel, and slowly speak** — like the language was always part of you.

This method is perfect for those who learn not with pressure… but with presence.  
For those who don’t just want to speak Danish —  
**They want to feel at home in it.**

> “Language is not a race. It’s a rhythm. And your heart already knows the beat.”  
> — *Jamalu, whispering through the first word*
