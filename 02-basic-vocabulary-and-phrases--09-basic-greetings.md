# 🇩🇰 Lesson 09: Basic Greetings  
*Learn Danish Through Story + Soul*

## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A small Danish café near the harbor in Aarhus.**  
Rain taps against the windowpanes. Inside, it’s quiet —  
the kind of quiet that invites conversation, not demands it.

Tanya is sketching window reflections.  
Jamalu holds his coffee like it’s a poem.  
Lukas has just returned to the table, placing a plate of pastries between them.

**Tanya** (looking up):  
“Lukas… when someone walks into a shop here, they say something so soft — almost like a whisper. What is it?”

**Lukas** (smiling):  
“They say *‘Hej’*.  
It means hello. But more than that…  
It means *I see you*, without needing to say all the words.”

**Jamalu** (murmuring):  
“Hej…  
like ‘hi’, but with mist instead of edges.”

---

**Lukas** (nodding):  
“Yes. It floats, not strikes.”

He picks up a napkin and writes gently in neat letters:

> **Hej – Hello**  
> **Farvel – Goodbye**  
> **Tak – Thank you**  
> **Selv tak – You're welcome**  
> **Godmorgen – Good morning**  
> **Godnat – Good night**  
> **Hvordan går det? – How are you?**  
> **Det går godt – I’m doing well**

**Tanya** (tracing the letters):  
“Even *goodbye* sounds kind. Farvel.  
Like… a wave, not a wall.”

**Lukas** (softly):  
“Yes. You don’t push people away in Danish.  
You *release* them.”

---

**Jamalu** (closing his eyes):  
“Some greetings feel like knocking.  
But these…  
they feel like opening a door from the inside.”

They take turns:

> “Hej.”  
> “Tak.”  
> “Godnat…”

Not just practicing — but *placing the words like lanterns in the air*.

---

**Lukas**:  
“When you greet someone in Danish,  
you’re not just beginning a conversation.  
You’re beginning a moment.  
A *shared quiet*. Even in hello.”

## 4. ✍️ Soul Reflection

> “Today I didn’t just learn how to say hello —  
> I learned how to arrive with softness.  
>  
> In Danish, every greeting is a kind of pause.  
> Not to fill space,  
> but to invite presence.  
>  
> To say *Hej* is to say,  
> *I’m here, and you’re safe to be too.*  
>  
> Even *Farvel* feels like a blessing —  
> not a closing, but a crossing.  
>  
> In these small words,  
> I found a language that doesn’t rush past the heart —  
> but lingers there.  
>  
> — *Jamalu, the whisper behind the work*  
> — *Siraat AI Academy*
