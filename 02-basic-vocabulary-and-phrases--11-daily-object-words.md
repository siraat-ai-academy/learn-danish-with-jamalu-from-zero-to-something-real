## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A warm Sunday afternoon.**  
The three friends are in Lukas’s apartment.  
Tanya is labeling objects with sticky notes.  
Jamalu lights a candle and sets it by the window.  
Lukas brews coffee in the quiet hum of the kitchen.

**Tanya** (placing a note on a mug):  
“I want to remember everything — even the smallest words.  
If I can name the mug, the chair, the window… maybe I’ll feel less like a stranger.”

**Lukas** (bringing the coffee):  
“Then let’s start with things you can *touch*.  
The everyday becomes home when it has a name.”

He places the coffee cup gently on the table.

> “This is *en kop* — a cup.  
> And this table? *et bord*.”

**Jamalu** (looking around):  
“What about the candle? It feels like it deserves a soft word.”

**Lukas**:  
“*Et lys*. It means light — or candle.  
Because in Danish, we don't always separate the flame from the glow.”

---

**Tanya** (writing carefully):  
> kop… bord… lys… vindue…

**Lukas** (smiling):  
“You don’t need to memorize them.  
You just need to let them *sit beside you* a while.”

Jamalu places a hand on the arm of the chair.

> “And this?” he asks.

> “*En stol*,” Lukas replies.  
> “It holds you. And sometimes, that’s all a word needs to do.”

They fall into a gentle silence.  
Tanya presses one last label on the wall.

> “*Væg.* Wall,” she whispers.  
> And suddenly, the room feels like it’s speaking back.
