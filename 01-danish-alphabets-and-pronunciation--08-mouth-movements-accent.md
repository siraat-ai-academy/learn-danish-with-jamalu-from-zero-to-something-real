## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A warm kitchen in Odense. A candle flickers. A bowl of berries sits untouched on the table. Jamalu watches Lukas in the mirror as they mimic sounds, slowly. Tanya leans on the windowsill, humming a lullaby.**

**👤 Jamalu**, adjusting his jaw with exaggerated care:  
*“I didn’t know Danish lived in the mouth like this. It’s not just voice — it’s movement.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, smiling:  
*“It’s like your lips have to trust the word before it arrives.”*

**💬 Lukas**, gently nodding:  
*“Yes. Danish is quiet. But the work your mouth does? It’s deep. Subtle. Every sound is wrapped in breath, and softened by the muscles behind the tongue.”*

He sips his tea and continues:  
*“To speak Danish clearly, you don’t force. You release. Loosen the jaw. Keep the lips relaxed, especially at the end of words.”*

**👤 Jamalu**, imitating:  
*“Farvel... tak... hej…”*  
Then pauses, feeling the shifts.  
*“It’s not sharp. It’s like placing the word on silk.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, sketching a mouth in motion:  
*“And your accent — it starts to melt into the sound when you stop *pushing* the sound.”*

**💬 Lukas** smiles:  
*“Exactly. You don’t *add* a Danish accent. You *let go* of everything else.”*

**👤 Jamalu**, softly:  
*“Maybe my voice was always ready. It was just waiting for me to trust the silence between the words.”*
