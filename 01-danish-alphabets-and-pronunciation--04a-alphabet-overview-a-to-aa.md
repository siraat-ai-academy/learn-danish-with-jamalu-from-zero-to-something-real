## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: An old attic studio in Aarhus. Rain against the skylight. A worn-out chalkboard stands in the corner. Paper, tea, and time.**

**👤 Jamalu** leans over a dusty box of children's alphabet cards:  
*“Each one looks familiar... but something in them feels like they’re waiting for me to listen, not just read.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, curling up beside him with a sketchbook:  
*“In Ukrainian, our letters hold echoes of home. I wonder — what do Danish letters carry?”*

**💬 Lukas** pulls a piece of chalk from behind his ear, smiling.  
*“They carry weather, sea, and silence. The Danish alphabet isn’t loud. It whispers.”*

He stands and writes on the board:

**A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Æ Ø Å**

**💬 Lukas** continues:  
*“We begin with A — like a breath opening.  
And we end with Å — like awe at the end of the world.”*

**👤 Jamalu** repeats, almost singing:  
*“Æ, Ø, Å…”*

**🎨 Tanya**, sketching the curves of Ø:  
*“They feel like the shape of emotions. Especially the ones we never say aloud.”*

**💬 Lukas**, softly:  
*“Exactly. Danish isn’t rushed. Each letter is a pause. A promise.”*

**👤 Jamalu**, pressing his palm to the board:  
*“So this is not just an alphabet… it’s a quiet dance.”*
