## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A small library corner in Copenhagen. Wooden shelves. Rain again. A candle flickers on the windowsill. The alphabet waits.**

**👤 Jamalu** whispers, flipping through a children’s book with large Danish letters:  
*“They look like my letters… but they move differently. They sing in another key.”*

**🎨 Tanya** smiles, tracing a finger over the page:  
*“I’ve seen ‘Å’ before but never knew how it danced. Lukas, will you teach us the rhythm?”*

**💬 Lukas** chuckles softly, settling into the chair beside them:  
*“It’s not about perfection. Just listen with your heart first — the Danish alphabet isn't strict. It's… felt.”*

He begins, softly:

*“A is like 'ah' — open, like the morning sky.*  
*B, not too sharp — just a hum in the lips.*  
*And then comes Æ — like ‘ai’ in ‘air’ — but slower, sweeter.*  
*Ø — like the world is turning in your mouth.*  
*And Å — my favorite — like saying ‘awe’ when you see the sea for the first time.”*

**👤 Jamalu** closes his eyes, repeating slowly:  
*“Æ… Ø… Å… It’s like praying with my tongue.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, gently laughing:  
*“Or painting vowels with candlelight.”*

**💬 Lukas** nods:  
*“Exactly. It’s not just A to Z — it’s A to Å. A full circle of breath.”*

**👤 Jamalu** places his hand on the book.  
*“So we don’t memorize. We remember — in the body.”*

> I held Æ like air, Ø like a secret, Å like wonder.
