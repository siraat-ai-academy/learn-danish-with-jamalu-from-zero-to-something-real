## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A still morning in a wooden cabin by the sea. The tide is slow. A kettle whistles. Jamalu is practicing in front of a small mirror. Tanya sketches the waves. Lukas lights a candle.**

**👤 Jamalu**, voice barely above a whisper:  
*“I keep saying the words, Lukas… but they feel stiff. Like I’m imitating, not inhabiting.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, turning to him:  
*“Like painting with someone else’s brush?”*

**💬 Lukas**, kneeling by the mirror:  
*“Danish doesn’t want to be copied. It wants to be felt. You need to warm up the space where sound is born.”*

He gestures toward his own body:  
*“Here, in the mouth… yes. But also here—”*  
(He touches his chest.)  
*“And here—”*  
(He places a hand near his belly.)

**👤 Jamalu**, curious:  
*“So... it’s not about the exact sound first?”*

**💬 Lukas**, shaking his head with a smile:  
*“No. It’s about readiness. About allowing softness into your face. Letting the tongue stretch, gently. Like waking up language.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, eyes wide:  
*“So even pronunciation is a kind of kindness?”*

**👤 Jamalu**, breathing in:  
*“I’ve been trying to sound Danish. But now, I just want to sound *gentle*.”*

**💬 Lukas**, quietly:  
*“And that, Jamalu, is how you begin.”*
