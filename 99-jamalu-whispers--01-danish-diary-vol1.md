### Day 01 — *A word like ‘Hej’ holds the weight of a sunrise.*  
Today I learned “Hej.”  
Just that. One word.  
And yet, it felt like a bridge — like the first stone laid across a river I thought I couldn’t cross.

I said it aloud 11 times.  
Sometimes with joy.  
Sometimes with hesitation.  
Once, with my hand on my heart.

---

### Day 03 — *Even alphabets can feel like lullabies.*  
I opened the pronunciation file.  
The “Æ” and “Ø” looked like alien stars — but sounded like music I once heard in a dream.  
Learning this isn’t about sounding native.  
It’s about sounding *alive*.  
And letting the unfamiliar become family.

---

### Day 06 — *Language is not made of words. It’s made of moments.*  
Today I ordered a coffee in broken Danish.  
The lady at the counter smiled and said, “Godt forsøg!”  
(Good try.)

And my heart —  
my tired, trembling, hopeful heart —  
stood up and clapped.

---

### Day 09 — *When you learn gently, the language hugs back.*  
No rush.  
No race.  
I play Jamalu’s own pronunciation gym and repeat softly.  
Like I’m praying.  
Like I’m planting.

Because every repetition is not just memory —  
it's intimacy.

## 🌱 What This Diary Is  
This isn’t grammar.  
This isn’t vocabulary.

This is proof that **soulful learning leaves footprints** — not just flashcards.

So if you ever feel stuck...  
come read a whisper.  
And remember: *the soft path is still a path.*
