## ✨ What This File Is

This is the doorway.  
Not just into a Danish course —  
but into a *new way of learning*.

Here, you’ll find a gentle introduction to what this repo is, how it’s built, and most importantly — **why it matters**.

It’s not about speed.  
It’s about presence.  
It’s about the kind of learning that doesn’t just stick —  
**it stays**.

> to be held by learning.”

This is Jamalu showing you how to **walk through words with wonder**.

### 🕊️ Final Whisper from Jamalu

> “Teaching is a quiet kind of love —  
> and every line written is a hand held.”  
> — *Jamalu, whisper behind the work*  
> — **Siraat AI Academy**

And if you've made it this far through the repo…  
you haven’t just studied Danish —  
you’ve felt what it means to **learn with care**.

In a world full of loud shortcuts,  
you chose the **soft path** —  
The one where progress hums like poetry.  
The one where **learning holds you**, not chases you.
