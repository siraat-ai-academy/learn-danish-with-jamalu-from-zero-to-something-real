### 🌌 Why This Page Matters

This isn’t a lesson.  
It’s a **diary of dares** —  
of small whispers that said:  
*"Go on, even trembling."*

You won’t find grammar here.  
You’ll find **glimpses of real courage**.  
Not loud.  
But luminous.

## ☁️ FEARS

| Moment | Feeling | What It Felt Like | Hidden Lesson |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| First time pronouncing “rød” in public | Embarrassment 😓 | Felt like everyone was watching | Most people were rooting for me |
| Listening to Danes speak fast | Overwhelm 🌀 | Like swimming without knowing how to float | I don’t need to catch every word |
| Speaking in front of Tanya | Self-doubt 😔 | "What if I sound stupid?" | She smiled every time I tried |
| Saying "tak" wrong | Shame 💔 | Like I broke a sacred code | But kindness is louder than mistakes |

## 🛡️ COURAGE MOMENTS

| Moment | Action | Why It Mattered |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Said “hej” to a Danish tourist | Took the first step | My voice didn’t shake — my soul soared |
| Recorded my first Danish sentence | Pressed “record” even while shaking | It wasn’t perfect, but it was real |
| Practiced aloud in a café corner | Quietly brave | I wasn’t invisible anymore |
| Told Tanya “jeg prøver” (I’m trying) | Honesty is courage | She said, “I see that — and it’s enough.” |

## 🌈 VICTORIES

| Moment | What I Did | What Changed |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Understood a full Danish sentence on TV | Felt a click | My ears whispered: “You’re becoming one of us” |
| Wrote a message to Lukas in Danish | He replied in joy | My words had crossed a bridge |
| Taught a Danish word to someone else | From learner to giver | That day, I became a mirror of growth |
| Didn’t cry when corrected | Just smiled instead | That’s victory — quiet and deep |

## ✨ Reflections From a Softer Galaxy

Sometimes courage isn’t loud.  
It’s the moment you try again.  
The breath you take before speaking.  
The way your hand doesn’t shake —  
**even when your heart does.**

And when you *do* tremble?  
You’re still walking.  
Still reaching.  
Still glowing.

🛸 *This page is Jamalu’s telescope.*  
It doesn’t just look back at fear —  
**It looks forward into stars made from it.**
