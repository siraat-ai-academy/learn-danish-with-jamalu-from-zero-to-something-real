## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A large wall calendar hangs in Lukas’s hallway.**  
Each square is hand-marked with little notes, birthdays, and soft scribbles.  
Tanya stands in front of it, tracing the weeks.  
Jamalu, barefoot as always, reads the months like verses.  
Lukas watches, smiling like someone who knows the rhythm of time.

**Tanya**:  
“I want to know the names of the days…  
but I don’t want to memorize them.  
I want to *walk* through them.”

**Lukas** (gently):  
“Then we begin on *mandag* — Monday.  
But we don’t march. We move like breath through the week.”

He points slowly:

> **mandag – tirsdag – onsdag – torsdag – fredag – lørdag – søndag**

---

**Jamalu** (softly):  
“They sound like waves —  
rising and resting…”

**Tanya**:  
“What do they mean?”

**Lukas**:  
“They come from old Norse gods, the moon, thunder…  
but now, they simply mean rhythm.  
Presence.”

---

**Jamalu**:  
“And the months?”

**Lukas**:  
“Like old stones smoothed by time —  
still carrying their shape,  
but softened by centuries.”

> **januar – februar – marts – april – maj – juni – juli – august – september – oktober – november – december**

---

**Tanya**:  
“Maj… it feels like a breath wrapped in flowers.”

**Jamalu**:  
“And søndag…  
it sounds like something sacred —  
like stillness wrapped in sky.”
