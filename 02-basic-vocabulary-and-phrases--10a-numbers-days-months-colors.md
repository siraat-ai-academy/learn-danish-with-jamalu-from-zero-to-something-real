## 1. 🧵 Emotional Story: The Lesson Through Dialogue

**Scene: A quiet wooden dock just before sunset. The lake glows golden. Lukas skims stones. Tanya counts them softly. Jamalu listens, barefoot, as the numbers ripple.**

**👤 Jamalu**, smiling:  
*“I used to think numbers were cold. Just facts. But in Danish, even numbers feel like lullabies.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, tossing another pebble:  
*“En… to… tre… fire… fem…”*  
She laughs.  
*“They land like footsteps on a soft path.”*

**💬 Lukas**, kneeling by the water:  
*“We don’t rush numbers. We let them breathe. Like seasons. You say them with space — not calculation.”*

**👤 Jamalu**, eyes closed:  
*“Tre… fire… fem…”  
*It’s like each one knows where it belongs. No hurry. No force.”*

**🎨 Tanya**, curiously:  
*“Lukas, do Danish children learn numbers with songs?”*

**💬 Lukas**, nodding:  
*“Yes. With songs, with rhythm. Because in Danish, learning isn’t about memorizing. It’s about remembering with your body.”*

**👤 Jamalu**, whispering:  
*“Then maybe today I didn’t just learn to count… I learned to trust the pace of my own voice.”*
